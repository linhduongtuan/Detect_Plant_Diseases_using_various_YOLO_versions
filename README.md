# Detect_Plant_Diseases_using_various_YOLO_versions
Recently, YOLOv4 [https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet] and YOLOv5 [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5] have been published.
Now, the repo shows the results were training using PlantDoc dataset with YOLOv3-spp, YOLOv4, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5l.
Dataset can be accessed here [https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/plantdoc/1].
How to train a variety of models and  more detailed tutorials can refer here [https://models.roboflow.ai/].
My weights of such models can be downloads at release site.
